  <name>SongRec</name>
  <summary>An open-source, unofficial Shazam client for Linux, written in Rust.</summary>
  <description>
    <p>Features:</p>
    <p>- Recognize audio from an arbitrary audio file.</p>
    <p>- Recognize audio from the microphone.</p>
    <p>- Usage from both GUI and command line (for the file recognition part).</p>
    <p>- Provide an history of the recognized songs on the GUI, exportable to CSV.</p>
    <p>- Continuous song detection from the microphone, with the ability to choose your input device.</p>
    <p>- Ability to recognize songs from your speakers rather than your microphone (on compatible PulseAudio setups).</p>
    <p>- Generate a lure from a song that, when played, will fool Shazam into thinking that it is the concerned song.</p>

  <releases>
    <release version="0.3.0" date="2021-12-26">
      <description>
        <p>- Introduce a new command-line interface allowing to use microphone recognition from the command line, with the "recognize" and "listen" commands (thanks to @Hummer12007), keeping older command backwards compatibility.</p>
        <p>- Update the CSV export format in order to introduce new "track_key", "release_year" and "genre" columns (thanks to @tyd), where "track_key" is an identifier internal to the Shazam database.</p>
        <p>- Allow exposing song metadata through the standard DBus MPRIS interface (thanks to @Hummer12007).</p>
        <p>- Improve source code structure in order to split the dual CLI/GUI parts from the core thread communication and fingerprinting parts and from other platform-dependant utility code.</p>
        <p>- Update certain dependent crates to more recent minor versions, among other possible things in order to accept a higher LibreSSL version.</p>
        <p>- Add the program version without the program help output (see the "-h" or "-V", "--version" options).</p>
        <p>- Add a Polish translation (thanks to @qarmin).</p>
        <p>- Update the French translation according to recent changes.</p>

      <description>
        <p>- Include a "Cargo.lock" file in the project so that it can be accepted in certain packaging systems that require freezing Rust dependencies to a known subversion.</p>
        <p>- Change the locale sent in HTTP requests to avoid to display internationalized song titles, in certain cases.</p>
        <p>- Fix a minor typo in the algorithm implementation that shouldn't impact recognition.</p>
        <p>- Improve portability.</p>

      <description>
