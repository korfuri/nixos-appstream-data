  <summary>Isometric 3D RPG similar to game Diablo</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
     FreedroidRPG is an original isometric 3D role playing game
     taking place in the future, on Earth. It features action and
     dialogs.
    </p>
    <p>
     The game tells the story of a world destroyed by a conflict between
     robots and their human masters. Play as Tux in a quest to save the
     world from the murderous rebel bots who know no mercy. You get to
     choose which path you wish to follow, and freedom of choice is
     everywhere in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
     FreedroidRPG features a real time combat system with melee and
     ranged weapons, fairly similar to the proprietary game Diablo.
     There is an innovative system of programs that can be run in order
     to take control of enemy robots, alter their behavior, or improve one's
     characteristics. You can use over 50 different kinds of items and
     fight countless enemies on your way to your destiny. An advanced
     dialog system provides story background and immersive role
     playing situations.
    </p>
    <p>
     The game is complete, fully playable, and can provide about
     12 hours of fun. It is still being actively developed, and
     help is welcome in many areas. People having - or trying to acquire -
     programming, map editing, or writing skills will find FreedroidRPG
     to be an exciting, fast-moving project in which they can fully
     express their creativity.
