  <description>
    <p>Worker is a two-pane file manager for the X Window System on
    UN*X. The directories and files are shown in two independent
    panels supporting a lot of advanced file manipulation
    features. The main focus is to make managing files easy with full
    keyboard control, also assisting in finding files and directories
    by using history of accessed directories, live filtering, and
    access to commands by using the keyboard.
